    Sunshine Books is a bookstore that's open every morning from 8:00 am to
    12:00 pm. The manager wasts information about the number of customers
    in the store at different times. A clerk, whose station is near the door,
    counts customers by making a mark on a piece of paper each time a customer
    enters. The paper is divided into four segments, one for each hour, and the
    clerk notes the time before making each mark. When the store closes at noon,
    the clerk wants to enter the numbers into a program, which then displays
    the total number of cusomters for the day and the average number of customers
    per hour.
    
    Your job, as the programmer, is to develop a program to calculate the customers
    for the day, and the average number of customers per hour.
    
    Assume the clerk has counted the following customers...
    
    Hour:Customers
    1:75
    2:96
    3:22
    4:108
    
    Calculate and Display the total customers for the day and the average customers per hour...
